Directory Marker Parser
=======================
*Making it easy to find your way in the woods*

# Description
The Directory Marker Parser allows one or more directories within a test bundle to be found via a property based on the folder name

# Usage
Place a .marker file in any directory that you need to find easily from within a test

Refer to this directory by name as a property: `${directory.name}`, this will provide the test with the full path to the location that was marked
